# 7.1 Spark
## Spark vs Hadoop
- Faster (10-100x)
- Written in Scala vs Java
- Batch, real-time, ... processing
- Easier to use
- Caches data in-mermory

## Resilient Distributed Datasets
- Resilient: Can be reconstructed
- Immutable, in-memory objects, only data retrieval and transformations

## RDD Transformations
- Result in new RDD
- Chain of transformation
  + List of transforms is kept in DAG
- Transformations are lazy
  + Executed only when result is requisted (Action)

## RDD Actions
- Request result
- Efficient
- In Parallel
- i.e: Request record count, first 10 rows, ...

## Dataframe vs Dataset
- Untyped vs typed
- Faster vs slower

## Accumulators and broadcast variables
Tasks run on individual workers are closures
Every task will contain a copy of the variables it works on
- Broadcast variables: One copy per node (read-only)
- Accumulators: One read/write copy per node, for counters, or sums
