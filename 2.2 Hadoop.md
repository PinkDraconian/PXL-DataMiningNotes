# 2.2 Hadoop
## Hadoop building blocks
- HDFS (Storage Layer)
  - Run on low-cost hardware
  - Expects hardware failures
  - Write-once-read-many
  - Break data into blocks of size 128 MB
  - Name node
    - Table of contents
    - Master node
    - Coordinates storage over the data nodes
  - Data node
    - Holds the actual data
    - Writes and replicates data (Rack-aware (Not on same rack))
- MapReduce (Application Layer)
- YARN (Resource Management Layer)

## HDFS Crashes
- Corrupted block
- Datanode crash
  - Replication in different locations
- Namenode crash
  - Checkpointing using fsImage (Backup on startup) and edits (log all edits)

## YARN
  - Splits up resource management and job scheduling/monitoring
  - Components
    - Resourcemanager
      - Global
      - Manages the assignment of compute resources
    - Application Master
      - Per-application
      - Runs shell commaonds in a container as directed by YARN
    - Nodemanager
      - Per-machine framework agent
      - Monitors container resource usage (CPU, memory, disk, network)
      - Reports to Resourcemanager

  ## MapReduce
  - Map
    - Processes input data line per line to a set of key/value pairs
    - Runs on local datanode (Multiple per datanode possible)
  - Reduce
    - Reduces a set of intermediate values which share a key to a smaller set of values
  - Combiner
    - Summarize the map output to reduce dolume of data between Map and Reduce
    - Runs on the same machine as Map
  - Partitioner
    - Default is hash function
    - Makes sure that all values of single key go to the same reducer, allows distribution of the reducer
