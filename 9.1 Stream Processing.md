# 9.1 Stream Processing

## Why stream processing
- Data in continuous streams
- Some insights are more/only valuable shortly after occuring
- No lag between event, insight and action
- Decentralizes and decouples infrastructure

## DStreams with RDDs vs DStreams with Dataframes
- DStream is continuous stream of RDDs
- Entities in a stream are grouped into batches
- Batch interval
+ Dstream as unbounded table
+ No batch interval

## Stateless vs stateful programming
- Transformations on single piece of data vs accumalive
